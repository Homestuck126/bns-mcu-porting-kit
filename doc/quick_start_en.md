## Quick Starts

### About Quick Starts

Development for SDK require the following prerequisite:

- An BNS MCU SDK
- A Linux machine running with Ubuntu 18.04 / Ubuntu 20.04 / Centos 7 / Centos 8
- MacOS and Windows users can develop our SDK in Linux enviroments by using Docker, Virtual machines or other methods

Depending on your operating system, our SDK supports serveral development enviroments:

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) : You need to install [C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) for VSCode. This extension enables you to develop and execute our SDK in Linux, MacOS and Windows enviroments.

- Command Line Interface (CLI)

The quickstarts are intended to guide you through the steps to install the software that SDK will need, configure the settings for Sample Code, and check the result after doing ledgerinput. Quick starts involved follwing steps:

<!-- no toc -->
1. [Download the SDK](#1-download-the-sdk)
2. [Install packages required to SDK](#2-install-packages-required-to-SDK)
3. [Configure setting for SDK Sample Code](#3-configure-the-settings-for-sample-code)
4. [Run the Sample code](#4-run-the-sample-code)
5. [Check the result](#5-check-the-result)

Complete the quickstarts for each steps, then you will be ready to run the tutorial and develop our SDK with your own applications.

### 1. Download the SDK

To download the code, you will need to install git (If not installed yet) and then type

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/itrustmachines/bns-mcu-porting-kit.git
```

### 2. Install packages required to SDK

Before you run the SDK, you need to add required Linux packages to your computer if they are not already installed. Depending on your Linix distribution, enter the following commands in terminal. You may omit packages that are already installed but make sure your **gcc version is higher than 7.5**, you can type `gcc --version` in terminal to check.

- Check gcc Verison
  
```shell
> gcc --version
gcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

```

- Ubuntu 18.04 / Ubuntu 20.04

```shell
> sudo apt install gcc g++ gdb make cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

- Centos 7

```shell
> sudo yum install centos-release-scl
> sudo yum install devtoolset-9
> sudo yum install gcc-c++ gdb cmake libcurl-devel
> scl enable devtoolset-9 bash
```

- Centos 8

```shell
> sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ gdb make cmake libcurl-devel
```

### 3. Configure the settings for Sample Code

This configuration file is very important. Main program use this configuration file to initialize the BNS Client. Configuration file includes private key, blockchain address, server URL setting ... etc.

- Modifying the configuration file require the following prerequisites:
  1. Private key : To make sure the reliability of every data source, we need a unique private key to process digital signature for each data source. We recommand to use [VANITY-ETH](https://vanity-eth.tk/) to generate the private key.
  
  2. Ethereum Blockchain Node URL : In order to get the onchain proof, we need to access the node of blockchain. We use Ethereum blockchain for our testing enviroment. The Ethereum blockchain node URL can obtain via Infura. Please check the [Infura tutorial](infura_en.md) to get the Rinkey Node URL.

After obtain the private key and Ethereum Node URL, then you will be ready to modify the configuration file [config.h](../example/bns-client-example/config.h). Please check the file and follow the instructions in file or below.

```C
/**
 * Please fill in the 128 bits (32 bytes) Hex encoded
 * private key which generated by VANITY-ETH
 */ 

#define PRIVATE_KEY "" 

/** 
 * Please fill in the index value of data source. 
 * The index value is the index of clearance. 
 * You can use device ID instead, if data source is coming from device.
 * But make sure the index value must be unique.
 */
#define INDEX_VALUE_KEY ""

/** Please fill in the EMAIL of BNS Account */
#define EMAIL ""

/** Please fill in the URL of BNS Server */
#define SERVER_URL "https://bns.itrustmachines.com/" 

/** 
 * Please fill in the Node URL of Rinkey which generated by Infura
 */
#define NODE_URL "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/{InfuraProjectId}" 
```

### 4. Run the Sample Code

#### CLI
##### make ( Only for Linux + GNU )

**There is currently no test fucntion. If you want to run the test, please check [cmake](#cmake)**

Move to SDK directory

```shell
> make clean
> make all
```

You can use `make help` to check avail options

Move to execution file directory

```shell
> cd bin
```

Excute the Sample code

```shell
> ./bns-client-example
```

The code will do ledgerinput ( send the CMD ) to BNS Server, you can let the code keep working and go to next topic to check the result of ledgerinput. If you want to terminate, you can use `crtl + c` at any time.

##### cmake

Move to SDK directory and create the build directory

```shell
> mkdir build
```

Move to build directory and compile the SDK

```shell
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
```

Run the test
```shell
> make test
```

**If you have meet implicit declaration of function problems during `make`, try to build with `make C_FLAGS=-std=gnu99`**

Move to execution file directory

```shell
> cd example/bns-client-example
```

Excute the Sample code

```shell
> ./bns-client-example
```

The code will do ledgerinput ( send the CMD ) to BNS Server, you can let the code keep working and go to next topic to check the result of ledgerinput. If you want to terminate, you can use `crtl + c` at any time.

#### VSCode

1. Choose GCC for Linux
2. Build
3. Choose bns-client-example, and execute the program
4. Run test

![vscode](../image/vscode.png)

### 5. Check the result

After excuting the sample code. The BNS Client will do ledgerinput. You can login and check the result of ledgerinput on [Blockchain Notary Service](https://bns.itrustmachines.com/) website.

----
Quickstarts is now complete. Next, learn how to build your own CMD.
